# ClassPortal
<i>ClassPortal</i> is a project that simplifies the E-learning processes.

# Project Purpose
Because of the Covid-19 outbreak coutries are in lockdown, educational institutes has been closed for a long time now. As a result the whole education system has become a messy. <br /> <br />
Even though a lot of institutes are try to take classes online, they aren't becoming so efficient. Even students and teachers needs to have accounts in multiple flatforms to stay in sync. As example, maybe teacher will take class in an online video conference app. But to have all students joined here, teacher needs to give link in an another platform. Then students may have any query for teacher, again for this reason they need to have accounts in a chatting application. So number of acounts goes up and up.
So in ClassPortal we tried to solve this part. We developed a web application where teacher can create Room and can post class links, students can comment/question, teacher can create different sections according to types of information he/she can share.
<br /> <br />
In this lockdown our <b>Hands-on Laboratory Activities</b> are suffering the most. Because Laboratory Activities are needed to conduct live. Even if we try to minimize it by arranging video conference, it won't be successful because students can't participate in the hands on laboratory experiments.
<br /> <br />
So, as the major part of our <i>ClassPortal</i> we tried to solve this issue by introducing <b>Interactive Simulation</b> in our project.
